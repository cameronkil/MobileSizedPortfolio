          <br>
          <div class="outline">
          <p> I've been enthusiastic about sport my entire life and found 
            a strong passion for running at a young age. Soon followed was cycling.
          When I joined highschool, i become involved in their intense swimming programme
        whilst also still doing the other two disciplines. It wasn't till a couple
      months into my first year at highschool that i made the decision to join
    their triathlon programme... 
    <br>
    <br>
    since that decision 7 years ago I haven't regretted it one bit! <br></p>
    </div>
    
    <p><br> Throughout the many years of triathlon I have...<br><br></p>
          
      <ul>
        <li> Completed <b> 250+</b> races.</li>
        <li> Raced in over <b>20+</b> locations in QLD/AUS.</li>
        <li> Met <b>thousands</b> of people.</li>
        <li> Made a few friends and a few enemies!</li>
        <li> Crashed <b>20+</b> times</li>
        <li> Raced at <b>state, national and oceania level,</b></li>
        <li> Won some races, DNF'd some races and lost a few races.</li>

      </ul>
      <br>
      <p> But most importantly through the blood, tears, and sweat i've 
        had fun!</p>
